    "# Astronomical Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the astronomical data that we will use during this course were obtained by the [Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)](http://www.sdss.org), which operated in three phases starting in 1998. The SDSS used a dedicated 2.5 m telescope at the Apache Point Observatory, New Mexico, equipped with two special-purpose instruments, to obtain a large volume of imaging and spectroscopic data. The 120 MP camera imaged the sky in five photometric bands (u, g, r, i, and z). As a result of the first two phases of SDSS, [Data Release 7](http://www.sdss.org/dr7/)\n",
    "has publicly released photometry for 357 million unique sources detected in ∼12,000\n",
    "deg<sup>2</sup> of sky (the full sky is equivalent to ∼40,000 degrees<sup>2</sup>). For bright sources, the\n",
    "photometric precision is 0.01–0.02 mag (1–2% flux measurement errors), and the\n",
    "faint limit is r ∼ 22.5. \n",
    "\n",
    "The SDSS imaging data were used to select a subset of sources for spectroscopic\n",
    "follow-up. A pair of spectrographs fed by optical fibers measured spectra for more than 600 galaxies, quasars and stars in each single observation. These spectra have\n",
    "wavelength coverage of 3800–9200 Å and a spectral resolving power of R ∼2000.\n",
    "Data Release 7 includes about 1.6 million spectra, with about 900,000 galaxies,\n",
    "120,000 quasars and 460,000 stars. The total volume of imaging and spectroscopic\n",
    "data products in the SDSS Data Release 7 is about 60 TB.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second phase of the SDSS included many observations of the same patch\n",
    "of sky, dubbed “Stripe 82.” This opens up a new dimension of astronomical data:\n",
    "the time domain. The Stripe 82 data have led to advances in the understanding of\n",
    "many time-varying phenomena, from asteroid orbits to variable stars to quasars and\n",
    "supernovas. The multiple observations have also been combined to provide a catalog\n",
    "of nonvarying stars with excellent photometric precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to providing an unprecedented data set, the SDSS has revolutionized\n",
    "the public dissemination of astronomical data by providing exquisite portals for easy\n",
    "data access, search, analysis, and download. For professional purposes, the Catalog\n",
    "Archive Server ([CAS](http://cas.sdss.org/astrodr7/en/tools/search/sql.asp)) and its SQL-based search engine is the most efficient way to\n",
    "get SDSS data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alongside the SDSS data, we also use the Two Micron All Sky Survey\n",
    "(2MASS) photometry for stars from the SDSS Standard Star Catalog. 2MASS used two 1.3 m telescopes to survey the entire sky in near-infrared\n",
    "light. The three 2MASS bands, spanning the wavelength range 1.2–2.2 µm (adjacent to the SDSS wavelength range on the red side), are called J , H, and Ks (“s” in Ks\n",

    "## Astronomical Flux Measurements and Magnitudes\n",
    "\n",
    "Astronomical magnitudes and related concepts often cause grief to the uninitiated. Here is a brief overview of astronomical flux measurements and the definition of\n",
    "astronomical magnitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Definition of the Specific Flux\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us assume that the specific flux of an object at the top of the Earth’s atmosphere,\n",
    "as a function of wavelength, $\\lambda$, is $F_ν(\\lambda)$. The specific flux is the product of the photon\n",
    "flux (the number of photons of a given wavelength, or frequency, per unit frequency,\n",
    "passing per second through a unit area) and the energy carried by each photon\n",
    "($E = hν$, where $h$ is the Planck constant, and $ν$ is the photon’s frequency). Often, the\n",
    "specific flux per unit wavelength, $F_\\lambda$, is used, with the relationship $νF_ν = \\lambda F_\\lambda$ always\n",
    "valid. The SI unit for specific flux is W Hz<sup>2</sup> m<sup>-2</sup>; in astronomy, a widely adopted\n",
    "unit is Jansky (Jy), equal to 10<sup>26</sup> Hz<sup>-1</sup> m<sup>2</sup> (named after engineer and radio\n",
    "astronomer Karl G. Jansky, who discovered extraterrestrial radio waves in 1933).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wavelength Window Function for Astronomical Measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "Strictly speaking, it is impossible to measure $F_ν(\\lambda)$ because measurements are always\n",
    "made over a finite wavelength window. Instead, the measured quantity is an integral\n",
    "of $F_ν(\\lambda)$, weighted by some window function, $W_b(\\lambda)$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "F_b = \\int^\\infty_0 F_v(\\lambda)\\,W_b(\\lambda)\\,d\\lambda\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $b$ stands for \"passband\", or wavelength \"bin\". Here. the window function has units of $\\lambda^{-1}$, and $F_b$ has the same units as $F_v(\\lambda)$ (the exact form of the window function depends on the nature of the measuring apparatus).\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, the window function can be, at least approximately, parametrized by\n",
    "its effective wavelength, $\\lambda_e$, and some measure of its width, $\\Delta\\lambda$. Depending on $W_b(\\lambda)$,\n",
    "with the most important parameter being the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda/\\lambda_e$, as well as on the number\n",
    "of different wavelength bins $b$, astronomical measurements are classified as spectra\n",
    "(small $\\Delta\\lambda/\\lambda_e$, say, less than 0.01; large number of bins, say, at least a few dozen)\n",
    "and photometry (large $\\Delta\\lambda/\\lambda_e$, ranging from ∼ 0.01 for narrowband photometry to ∼ 0.1 and larger for broadband photometry, and typically fewer than a dozen\n",
    "different passbands).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many astronomical photometric systems in use, each with its own\n",
    "set of window functions, $W_b(\\lambda)$ (which sometimes are not even known!). As an example, the SDSS passbands (the displayed total transmission\n",
    "is proportional to $\\lambda W_b(\\lambda))$ are shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/sdss_passbands.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Astronomical Magnitude System\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The above discussion of flux measurements is fairly straightforward and it applies to all wavelength regimes, from X-rays to the radio. Enter optical astronomers.\n",
    "For historical reasons (a legacy of Hipparchus and Ptolemy, and a consequence\n",
    "of the logarithmic response of the human eye to light), optical astronomers use a\n",
    "logarithmic scale to express flux,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "m \\equiv -2.5\\,\\text{log}_{10}\\,\\left( \\frac{F_b}{F^0_b}\\right)\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the normalization flux, $F^0_b$, depends on the passband $b$ (at least in principle). Note also the factor of 2.5, as well as the minus sign which makes magnitudes increase as the flux decreases (a star at the limit of the human eye’s sensitivity,\n",
    "m = 6, is 100 times fainter than a star with m = 1). Nevertheless, this a\n",
    "simple mathematical transformation and no harm is done as long as $F_b^0$ is known.\n",
    "Traditionally, astronomical measurements are calibrated *relative* to an essentially\n",
    "arbitrary celestial source of radiation, the star Vega. Since Vega’s flux varies with\n",
    "wavelength, in most photometric systems (meaning a set of $W_b(\\lambda)$ and corresponding $F^0_b$), $F^0_b$ varies with wavelength as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of progress in absolute calibration of astronomical photometric\n",
    "measurements, a simplification of astronomical magnitude systems was proposed. Oke and Gunn defined the so-called AB magnitudes by $F^0_b$ = 3631 Jy,\n",
    "irrespective of wavelength and particular $W_b(\\lambda)$. The SDSS magnitudes, are reported on AB magnitude scale. For example, the\n",
    "SDSS bright limit at r = 14 corresponds to a specific flux of 9 mJy, and its faint limit\n",
    "at r = 22.5 corresponds to 3.6 µJy.\n"
